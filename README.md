## Contents:
### VAEmodel 
Contains the VAE models used.

### Training  
Contains the script that runs the training of the VAE models.

### Plots  
Contains tools to plot input and output variables, latent variables, correlation matrix and ROC curves.

### SHAP  
Contains tools to understand which features are contributing the most to the loss of the model.

### VAE and DNN:
Contains a new version of the model, comprised of a simple VAE together with a DNN that serves as a classifier for SM - EFT discrimination
